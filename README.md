What is Project Euler?

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require 
more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant 
and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

In this repo you will find my solutions to the problems as I solve them in Python 3. Though I may also 
incorporate Javascript in the near future. I will also comment on each problem at a future date,
but right now my focus is on solving as many as possible.
